    "message": "I’m uploading a new batch of lessons and spending time refining existing ones. This update focuses on the て-form and its core uses.\n\nNew lessons include how to make the て-form, using 〜てください to make polite requests, connecting two actions with the て-form, asking for permission with 〜てもいいです, and saying something is not allowed with 〜てはいけません.\n\nRight now, I’m prioritizing lesson clarity over exercises. Some lesson → exercise links are not working correctly at the moment; this is a known issue and will be fixed later.\n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve reviewed some of this material myself, so my main focus right now is making sure I fully understand what I’m uploading and that someone completely new to Japanese can follow along without getting lost.\n\nLooking ahead, the plan is to continue refining lessons, expand beginner grammar coverage, and then circle back to clean up exercise links and overall lesson flow once the foundations feel solid."
